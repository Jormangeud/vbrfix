BUILDING
--------
Installing QT is the difficult bit:
Information can be found in the trolltech qt documentation (http://doc.trolltech.com/). Click GettingStarted-> Installation -> choose your platform

Building may take up a lot of Hard Disk space (potentially in excess of 10GB) particularly when using the Visual Studio methods.

Static linking has the advantage that the QT dlls do not need to be distributed with the VbrFix application. I'd only use static if you want to produce versions to distribute.

These methods are only a simple guide and an element of luck is required.

BUILDING ON WINDOWS
-------------------

Method 1: (Visual Studio Express)
	(I think method 2 may be more 'correct', but this one may be easier, uses less disk space and it seems to work better)
	Install MS Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition
	Follow the same steps as Method 3 but instead of doing 'build the debug libraries' do:
		In visual studio setup the VC++ Directories to include QT (do include, lib and executables) (not sure if this step in required)
		Open the Visual Studio Express Command Prompt (from start menu\ms vis c++ express edition\vis stud tools)
		Type 'configure' wait for a bit
		Type 'nmake' wait for a bit
	Continue method 2 from the 'wait for ages' part
	You may need to copy dlls from the qt install directory/bin into the directory where you built VbrFix in order to run it

Method 2: (Visual Studio Express)
	Install MS Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition
	Find trolltech website and download something like qt-win-opensource-src-4.4.3.zip
	Unzip it into a dir like c:\Qt\4.4.3
	In visual studio setup the VC++ Directories to include QT (do include, lib and executables) (not sure if this step in needed)
	Open the Visual Studio Express Command Prompt (from start menu\ms vis c++ express edition\vis stud tools)
	Type 'configure -platform win32-msvc -static'
	Wait for a bit
	Type 'nmake'
	Wait for ages (don't panic should it not all compile, just as long as most of it seems to have)
	Get the VbrFix source code into a directory somewhere
	In the Visual Studio command prompt 'cd' to the directory where VbrFix is located
	Modify createvcproj.bat to use the location of QT if it's not c:\Qt\4.4.3
	Run createvcproj.bat (all it does is c:\Qt\4.4.3\bin\qmake.exe -tp vc -r)
	Open the vbrfix.sln file that has been created in Visual Studio Express and build it)
	
Method 3: (mingw)
	Find trolltech website and download something like qt-win-opensource-4.4.3-mingw.exe
	Run the installer
	Build the qt debug libs (should be on the start menu, takes a long time ~ 2 hours)
	Get the vbrfix source code into a directory somewhere
	Open the qt command prompt (on the start menu under QT somewhere)
	In the opened command prompt 'cd' to the directory where VbrFix is located
	Type 'qmake vbrfix.pro' return
	Type 'make' return
	You may need to copy dlls from the qt install directory/bin into the directory where you built VbrFix in order to run it

BUILDING ON OTHER PLATFORMS
---------------------------
Building on Linux should be very simple as long as you can get QT4 installed.
	Download the source
	'qmake vbrfix.pro'
	'make'
Mac:
	Some people have managed to build it and produce executables. 
	Currently I'm not sure how they did it. The only difficult bit should be setting up QT on the Mac.
	Please let me know if you know how to do this so I can provide a simple guide
