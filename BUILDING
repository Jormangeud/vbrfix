BUILDING
--------
Installing QT is the difficult bit:
Information can be found in the trolltech qt documentation (http://doc.trolltech.com/). Click GettingStarted-> Installation -> choose your platform

Static linking has the advantage that the QT dlls do not need to be distributed with the VbrFix application.

These methods are only a simple guide and an element of luck is required.

BUILDING ON WINDOWS
-------------------
Method 1: (Visual Studio Express)
	Install MS Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition
	Find trolltech website and download something like qt-win-opensource-src-4.4.3.zip
	Unzip it into a dir like c:\Qt\4.4.3
	Open the Visual Studio Express Command Prompt (from start menu\ms vis c++ express edition\vis stud tools)
	Type 'configure -platform win32-msvc' (add -static for static linking)
	Type 'nmake sub-src'
	Type 'nmake sub-tools'
	Get the VbrFix source code into a directory somewhere
	In the Visual Studio command prompt 'cd' to the directory where VbrFix is located
	Type 'c:\Qt\4.4.3\bin\qmake.exe -tp vc -r'
	Open the newly created vbrfix.dsw file with Visual Studio Express, do any requested coversion
	Build and run.
	(non-static mode) - You may need to copy dlls from the qt install directory/bin into the directory where you built VbrFix in order to run it
	Note all project changes must be done through the .pro files and then 'c:\Qt\4.4.3\bin\qmake.exe -tp vc -r' rerun
	
Method 3: (mingw)
	Find trolltech website and download something like qt-win-opensource-4.4.3-mingw.exe
	Run the installer
	Build the qt debug libs (should be on the start menu, takes a long time ~ 2 hours)
	Get the vbrfix source code into a directory somewhere
	Open the qt command prompt (on the start menu under QT somewhere)
	In the opened command prompt 'cd' to the directory where VbrFix is located
	Type 'qmake vbrfix.pro'
	Type 'make'
	You may need to copy dlls from the qt install directory/bin into the directory where you built VbrFix in order to run it

BUILDING ON OTHER PLATFORMS
---------------------------
Building on Linux should be very simple as long as you can get QT4 installed.
	Download the source
	'qmake vbrfix.pro'
	'make'
Mac:
	Some people have managed to build it and produce executables. 
	Currently I'm not sure how they did it. The only difficult bit should be setting up QT on the Mac.
	Please let me know if you know how to do this so I can provide a simple guide
